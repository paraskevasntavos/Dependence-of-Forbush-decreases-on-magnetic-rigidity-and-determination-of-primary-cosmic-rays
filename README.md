This work was conducted during the 4th year of my undergraduate studies and constitutes a group project within the framework of the Nuclear Physics and Elementary Particle Physics Specialization Laboratory, accounting for 40% of each student’s final grade. The subject of the study is Forbush decreases and their dependence on magnetic rigidity, while simultaneously attempting to estimate primary Cosmic Rays through data analysis. For this purpose, we employ the Wawrzynczak–Alania methodology in combination with the Clem–Dorman coupling function, in order to correlate measurements of secondary cosmic rays with characteristics of the primary component. As a data source, we use neutron monitor measurements from the NMDB database. The stations OULU, ROME, and SOPB are examined—differing in geographical location, altitude, and characteristic rigidity—and the time intervals 18/10/2021–18/11/2021, 09/03/2024–09/04/2024, and 25/05/2025–25/06/2025 are analyzed.

The full implementation of the analysis is provided in project.ipynb, the paper we prepared for this work can be found in project.pdf, and the presentation slides delivered to an audience of fellow students after completing the code and the paper are available in slides.pdf. 

This work was carried out in collaboration with Konstantina Vasilopoulou, under the supervision of Maria Gerontidou.
